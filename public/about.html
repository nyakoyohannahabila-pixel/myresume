<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I’m Nyako Yohanna — a Certified Virtual Assistant for startups providing structured remote administrative and technical support to founders and growing teams.</p>

<p>I work with early-stage startups that need reliable operational support without the cost of full-time in-house staff. My role is simple: build organized systems, manage daily operations, and reduce workflow friction so founders can focus on product, strategy, and growth.</p>

<h2>Startup-Focused Virtual Assistant Services</h2>
<p>I provide:<ul>
  <li>Email and calendar management</li>
  <li>CRM management and data tracking</li>
  <li>Operations support and workflow documentation</li>
  <li>Online research and reporting</li>
  <li>Website content updates</li>
  <li>Technical support and system troubleshooting</li>
  <li>Administrative support for remote teams</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
  With a background in IT management and a degree in Computer Science, I bring technical awareness to administrative work. I previously managed IT infrastructure, digital platforms, and internal support systems — experience that translates directly into structured startup operations support.
</p>
<p>
  I also hold a Professional Certificate in Virtual Assistance, with formal training in remote administrative support, productivity tools, client communication, and digital workflow management.
</p>
<h2>Why Startups Work With Me</h2>
<p>
  Startups move quickly. Systems break. Processes evolve. Priorities shift.
</p>
<p>
  I operate comfortably in fast-paced environments and understand how to:
  <ul>
    <li>Create organized processes from chaos</li>
    <li>Improve documentation and reporting</li>
    <li>Support distributed teams across time zones</li>
    <li>Maintain professional communication standards</li>
  </ul>
  If you're a startup founder looking for a dependable remote Virtual Assistant who understands both operations and technology, I’d be glad to support your growth.
